### Hello! My name is Suchandra Datta :fallen_leaf: I'm a Computer Science student, currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science.
### :jack_o_lantern: I strive to convert ideas into functioning applications that solve real-world problems. I am obssessed and in love with the tech world, spending my time making the stuff you can see in the different repositories here, they're far from perfect but I love working on them. Have a look around!
### :jack_o_lantern: In my spare time, I write technical articles related to my projects or on topics I am currently working on. 

### Here's a link to my articles if you want to read(I would love feedback, suggestions and constructive criticism)
